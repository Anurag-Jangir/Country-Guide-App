# Country-Guide-App
* I've used **Asynchronous JavaScript** in this project.
- I was able to _retrieve_ user coordinates and display their corresponding places by using the **Geocode API**.
* Additionally, I used the **Restcountries API** to allow users to search and view specific information on the countries they have searched.
- I employed the **fetch()** approach.
* Additionally, this app effectively uses **catch()** to handle any errors.
